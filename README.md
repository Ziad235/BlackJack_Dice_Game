# BlackJack_Dice_Game

### How the game is played:
Two players alternately roll dice, and keep track of their total across turns.   
They are each trying to reach a sum that lies in a specified target, between a fixed low value and high value. If a player reaches a score in the target range, they immediately win.   
If a player exceeds the high value, the player immediately loses.  
The players can choose the number of dice to roll on each turn, between 1 and a fixed maximum.  

### The game has 5 parameters:
- _NSides_ (int): The number of sides of the die. The die is numbered 1 to _NSides_, and all outcomes are equally likely.
- _LTarget_ (int): The lowest winning value.
- _UTarget_ (int): The highest winning value.
- _NDice_ (int): The maximum number of dice a player may roll.
- _M_ (float): A hyperparameter that controls the "explore/exploit" trade-off.


#### How to run program:
- Make sure Python3 is installed.
- Run the program on the terminal using "python3 <program_name>.py".


_Note that this is not an interactive game. It is merely a program simulates the game between two players in order to give the user an optimal playing strategy._  

_The outputs of the program are two LTarget Ã— LTarget arrays, the correct number of dice to roll in state (X, Y), and
the probability of winning if you roll the correct number of dice._
